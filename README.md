# Weather_Prediction

In this project I will use weather data to make predictions on weather outcome. Data cleaning is pretty simple, might have a bit of a harder time making the new predictors and fitting the model.

#### Steps:
- Download data
- Clean and analyze data
- Make additional predictors
- Fit a model and make predictions
- Evaluate accuracy

#### Installations:
  - Python
  - Python packages:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - Ridge from scikit-learn

#### Data

For this project the data was ready for me to use. If I were to collect the data myself, I would go to [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search), a U.S. Government agency.
